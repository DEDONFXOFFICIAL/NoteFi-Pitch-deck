# NoteFi – Your Memory, On-Chain


## Title

### NoteFi  
🧠 A Smart Notepad with AI-Powered Reminders  
🔗 Built for Web3, backed by Solana + Xandeum  

> "Don’t just write it down. Let it remember for you."


## The Problem

People forget things all the time:

- Deadlines, calls, ideas, even tasks they wrote down.  
- Web2 notepads don’t integrate reminders.  
- Web3 tools rarely support daily utility apps.  
- Decentralized apps don’t usually offer smart UX or alarms.

> We’re still relying on sticky notes and memory — even in 2025.


## The Solution

NoteFi = Notepad + AI + Web3

- **Smart Reminders**: Just write “Call Victor at 5PM,” and it sets an alarm.  
- **On-Chain Notes**: Stored on Xandeum with encryption.  
- **Reminder Anchoring**: Fast, verifiable scheduling via Solana.  
- **Offline-Active**: Reminders work even without internet.


## How It Works

1. User connects wallet (via WalletConnect).  
2. Writes notes (daily thoughts, tasks, or reminders).  
3. AI scans for time-based triggers, asks permission to set reminders.  
4. Data is saved on-chain. Alarm activates locally on device clock.  
5. Offline? Reminder still works.

> No APIs. No servers. Just local + on-chain sync.


## Monetization
